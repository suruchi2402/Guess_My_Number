# Guess_My_Number
This is something like game where we will guess our lucky win number by common sense like if there will be showing very low then we will increase our number by guess and if there will be showing very high then we will decrease our guessed number. And it is implemented using random function of javascript and for styling purpose we have used CSS here.
